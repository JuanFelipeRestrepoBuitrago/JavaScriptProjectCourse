# JavaScript Course
This repository contains all the work that I have made for the JavaScript course at Platzi. It contains both teorical and practical directory, where files are stored depending on the course.

- TeoryCourse, contains files with exercises for the teorical course.
- PracticalCourse, contains files with the project and exercises for the practical course.
