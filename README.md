# JavaScript Course

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/On-green?label=Website)](https://juanfeliperestrepobuitrago.github.io/FrontendDeveloperProject/)

This repository contains all the work that I have made for the JavaScript course at Platzi. It contains both teorical and practical directory, where files are stored depending on the course.

- TeoryCourse, contains files with exercises for the teorical course.
- PracticalCourse, contains files with the project and exercises for the practical course.

## Project

The project for this course consists of merging the HTML files of the Frontend Developer Course Project into one using JavaScript. The repo's JavaScriptCourse branch contains the merged file.
